# Senticor Project's Five-Phase Task Management Methodology

This document describes how Senticor Project implements a structured
five-phase task management methodology, combining disciplined
processing with an elegant user experience.

## The 5 Phases

### 1. Capture

> "The fewer things on your mind, the more you can focus on what matters."

Everything starts in the **Inbox**. The capture mechanism must be:

- **Fast**: &lt;2 seconds from thought to captured item
- **Frictionless**: Single input field, keyboard shortcut, or voice
- **Complete**: Every captured item records its **source** (thought, email, meeting, voice, import)
- **Non-judgmental**: No categorization at capture time

The Inbox is a **FIFO queue**. Items are processed oldest-first.
No cherry-picking — this enforces the discipline of processing everything.

### 2. Clarify

Processing each inbox item with a structured decision tree:

```
Is it actionable?
├── YES
│   ├── Will it take <2 minutes? → DO IT NOW
│   ├── Should someone else do it? → DELEGATE (Waiting)
│   └── What's the next action?
│       ├── Single action → NEXT
│       ├── Multi-step → create PROJECT + first action
│       └── Time-specific → CALENDAR
└── NO
    ├── Trash → ARCHIVE (no delete!)
    ├── Maybe later → LATER
    └── Useful info → REFERENCE
```

**Key clarification outputs:**

- **Desired outcome** (DefinitionPort: what does "done" look like?)
- **Next physical action** (the very next thing you can do)
- **Context** (where/how: @phone, @computer, @errands, @office)
- **Project** (if multi-step: what project does this belong to?)

### 3. Organize

Route clarified items to their correct bucket:

| Bucket        | Criteria                                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Next**      | Actionable, can be done as soon as context allows |
| **Projects**  | Outcome requiring &gt;1 action, target &lt;1 year |
| **Waiting**   | Delegated, with person + date noted               |
| **Calendar**  | Must happen on a specific date/time               |
| **Later**     | Not committed now, review during weekly review    |
| **Reference** | Not actionable, but useful information            |

Each item gets:

- **Contexts** (one or more: @phone, @computer, @home, @sarah)
- **Tags** (flexible categorization)
- **Energy level** (low/medium/high)
- **Time estimate** (5min, 15min, 30min, 1hr, 2hr, half-day, full-day)

### 4. Reflect

#### Review (~60-90 minutes weekly)

The weekly review is the backbone of Senticor Project's methodology:

1. **Clear inbox** — process every remaining item (FIFO enforced)
2. **Review Next** — are these still relevant? Any completed?
3. **Review Projects** — each project has a defined next action?
4. **Review Waiting** — follow up on delegated items?
5. **Review Later** — promote anything to active?
6. **Review Calendar** — upcoming commitments?
7. **Review Focus** — re-evaluate what deserves focus?

#### Daily Review (~5-15 minutes)

1. Clear new inbox items
2. Check today's calendar
3. Scan Focus list
4. Pick 3-5 items for today

### 5. Engage

Work from your lists based on:

1. **Context** — what can I do right now? (filtered by @context)
2. **Time available** — how much time do I have?
3. **Energy** — what's my energy level?
4. **Priority** — what has the highest impact?

The **Focus list** surfaces items you've explicitly marked
as high-priority, cutting through list noise.

## Disciplined Inbox Processing

### FIFO Inbox Processing

The inbox enforces **First In, First Out** order. You must process the
oldest item before moving to the next. This is intentionally strict — it
prevents avoidance of difficult items.

Implementation:

- Inbox items sorted by `createdAt` ascending
- Only the first item shows the "Clarify" button
- Cannot skip or reorder inbox items

### Sequential Project Actions

Within a project, sub-actions are **ordered** and only the **next action**
is visible in the Next list. Subsequent actions are hidden until
the current one completes.

This prevents:

- Overwhelm from seeing all project steps at once
- Working out of order
- Losing track of what's actually next

When an action completes, the next one in sequence auto-promotes to visible.

## Smart Lists and Scheduling

### Focus List

A **virtual bucket** — not a separate list, but a filtered view.
Items are marked `isFocused: true` and appear in the Focus view.

Focus is:

- Manually toggled (star/unstar)
- Auto-assigned when a scheduled item's date arrives
- Reviewed daily

### Scheduled Items

Actions can have a `startDate`. Until that date arrives, they live in
a "Scheduled" state (visible but dimmed). On the start date, they:

1. Auto-promote to the Next list
2. Receive a Focus star
3. Send a notification (if configured)

### Recurring Tasks

Items can have a `RecurrencePattern`:

| Pattern                | Example                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Daily (every N days)   | "Take vitamins" every 1 day               |
| Weekly (specific days) | "Team standup" every Mon/Wed/Fri          |
| Monthly (day of month) | "Pay rent" on the 1st                     |
| Yearly (month + day)   | "Annual review" every March 15            |
| After completion       | "Clean desk" 7 days after last completion |

When a recurring item completes, a new instance is automatically created
with the next scheduled date.

## Evidence-First Processing (from Papers)

Senticor Project's Clarify phase maps to the "three-phase processing" from the
[FRBR evidence-first architecture](?path=/docs/engineering-ontology-frbr-knowledge-graph--docs) paper:

| Paper Phase                       | App Phase | What Happens                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1: Classification           | Capture   | Item enters inbox, source recorded, basic type detected               |
| Phase 2: Hierarchy + Placeholders | Clarify   | Create project/action structure, mark unknowns with `needsEnrichment` |
| Phase 3: Enrichment               | Ongoing   | Fill gaps: add context, effort estimates, done criteria               |

**Confidence scores** track how well-defined an item is:

- **High** (0.9+): Fully clarified, clear next action + outcome + context
- **Medium** (0.7-0.9): Has outcome but missing details
- **Low** (&lt;0.7): Raw capture, needs clarification

Items with `needsEnrichment: true` surface in review flows.
