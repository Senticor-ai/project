# Product Roadmap Projects

Delivery-oriented roadmap items that are not part of active epics.

## Copilot V3

Deferred from [Copilot V2+](?path=/docs/product-completed-epics-copilot-v2--docs) (closed).

Draft implementation detail:
[Epic: Advanced Knowledge Base](?path=/docs/product-epics-advanced-knowledge-base--docs)

| Project             | Problem solved                                                                    | Scope                                                              | Status  | Depends on          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------------- |
| Context Budget      | No token counting or summarization — long conversations may exceed context window | Token counting per message, summarization of older turns           | Planned | None                |
| RAG / Embeddings    | Large workspaces can't fit in prompt context; need semantic retrieval             | Vector store (Qdrant), embedding pipeline, retrieval in agent loop | Planned | None                |
| Conversation Titles | Conversations have no auto-generated titles, harder to find in history            | Auto-summarize first message as title, editable by user            | Planned | None                |
| Conversation Search | No way to search across past conversations                                        | Full-text search over conversation content                         | Planned | Conversation Titles |

### Near-term sequence

1. Context Budget
2. RAG / Embeddings
3. Conversation Titles
4. Conversation Search

## Release & Deployment

Seeded from [Epic: Release Process](?path=/docs/product-completed-epics-release-process--docs) (closed).

| Project                | Problem solved                                                             | Scope                                                        | Status  | Depends on     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | -------------- |
| Named Releases         | Production deploys are SHA-only, without human-friendly release tags/notes | `VERSION` file, release script, SemVer tags, GitHub releases | Planned | None           |
| Release Evidence       | Test and coverage outputs are not attached to named releases               | Collect CI artifacts and attach to release assets            | Planned | Named Releases |
| Post-Deploy Smoke      | Deploy success is inferred from pipeline completion only                   | Add production smoke checks after manifest update            | Planned | None           |
| Supply-Chain Hardening | No SBOM/signature assets for release images                                | SBOM generation + image signing process                      | Planned | Named Releases |
| Change Governance      | Changelog and commit hygiene are ad-hoc                                    | Changelog automation, commit policy, rollback runbook        | Planned | Named Releases |

### Near-term sequence

1. Named Releases
2. Release Evidence
3. Post-Deploy Smoke
4. Supply-Chain Hardening
5. Change Governance
