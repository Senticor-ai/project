# Senticor Project: Product Vision

## What Is Senticor Project?

A **structured task management system** that brings a disciplined
five-phase methodology into a modern, evidence-first workspace,
grounded in concepts from knowledge graph architecture
([FRBR](?path=/docs/engineering-ontology-frbr-knowledge-graph--docs),
[LexCEL](?path=/docs/engineering-ontology-lexcel-architecture--docs)).

## Core Workflow

### The 5 Phases

| Phase        | Action  | Description                               |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Capture**  | Collect | Everything goes into the Inbox            |
| **Clarify**  | Process | Is it actionable? What's the next action? |
| **Organize** | Route   | Assign to the correct bucket              |
| **Reflect**  | Review  | Weekly review of all lists                |
| **Engage**   | Do      | Execute from context-aware lists          |

### The Buckets

| Bucket        | Purpose                                | Color          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Inbox**     | Unprocessed captures                   | Warm amber     |
| **Next**      | Immediately actionable, context-tagged | Green          |
| **Projects**  | Multi-step outcomes                    | Blueprint blue |
| **Waiting**   | Delegated or dependent items           | Purple         |
| **Later**     | Deferred aspirations                   | Cool cyan      |
| **Calendar**  | Time-specific commitments              | Red-orange     |
| **Reference** | Supporting materials                   | Muted olive    |
| **Focus**     | Filtered priority view                 | Bold orange    |

## Design Principles

### Discipline

- **Newest-First Inbox**: The most recently captured item appears at the top.
  Quick-entry items are immediately visible without scrolling.
- **Sequential Projects**: Sub-actions within a Senticor Project are ordered.
  Only the next action is visible until the current one completes.
- **Structured Methodology Adherence**: The system enforces the methodology, not just suggests it.

### Elegance

- **Focus List**: A virtual filtered bucket showing only highest-priority items.
  Not a separate list — a lens over existing items marked as "focused".
- **Scheduled Items**: Actions with a start date stay in "Scheduled" until the date
  arrives, then auto-promote to Next with a Focus star.
- **Recurring Tasks**: Built-in support for repeating items with configurable cycles.
- **Clean UI**: Minimal chrome, maximum content. Paper-like surfaces.

## Knowledge Architecture (from Papers)

Senticor Project's data model draws from three academic papers on legal knowledge
graph architecture, mapping their concepts to task management:

### FRBR Hierarchy → Item Identity

| FRBR Level        | App Mapping  | Example                             |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Work**          | Project      | "Launch website redesign"           |
| **Expression**    | Action       | "Draft wireframes for homepage"     |
| **Manifestation** | Context view | Same action shown in @computer list |
| **Item**          | Execution    | Doing it right now, this instance   |

**Evidence-first principle**: Always create the full hierarchy with placeholders.
Items enter as raw captures and get progressively enriched through clarification.

### LexCEL → Typed Relationships

Actions connect to each other via **typed references** (not just plain links):

| Reference Type | Meaning                                 | Example                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `blocks`       | This item blocks another                | "Get approval" blocks "Start development" |
| `depends_on`   | Cannot start until dependency completes | "Deploy" depends_on "Pass tests"          |
| `delegates_to` | Assigned to someone else                | "Review PR" delegates_to "@sarah"         |
| `refers_to`    | Cross-reference                         | "Budget doc" refers_to "Q4 Plan"          |
| `part_of`      | Sub-action of a Senticor Project        | "Write tests" part_of "Launch redesign"   |
| `follows`      | Sequential ordering                     | Step 2 follows Step 1                     |
| `waiting_on`   | External dependency                     | "Waiting on vendor response"              |

### LexCEL Ports → Action Attributes

| Port Type           | Usage                                  | Example                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **DefinitionPort**  | What does "done" mean?                 | "Homepage wireframes approved by team" |
| **PredicatePort**   | What conditions must be true to start? | "Design system tokens finalized"       |
| **ComputationPort** | Effort/time/energy estimates           | 2hr, high energy                       |
| **ProcedurePort**   | Checklists / sub-steps                 | [ ] Header, [ ] Nav, [ ] Hero          |

### Three-Phase Processing → Capture-Clarify-Enrich

| Phase   | Paper Concept               | Implementation                                                   |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 | Heuristic classification    | Capture: item enters inbox, auto-tagged with source              |
| Phase 2 | Hierarchy with placeholders | Clarify: create Senticor Project/action structure, mark unknowns |
| Phase 3 | Optional enrichment         | Enrich: fill in missing context, effort, done criteria           |

### Confidence Scores

Every item carries a confidence score indicating how well-defined it is:

- **High**: Fully clarified — clear next action, defined outcome, assigned context
- **Medium**: Partially clarified — has outcome but missing context or effort
- **Low**: Raw capture — needs significant clarification
- **Needs enrichment**: Flagged `needsEnrichment` for review (FRBR pattern)

### Canonical IDs

Every item gets a stable URN-style identifier:

```
urn:app:inbox:a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
urn:app:action:b2c3d4e5-f6a7-8901-bcde-f12345678901
urn:app:project:c3d4e5f6-a7b8-9012-cdef-123456789012
```

Stable IDs enable: provenance tracking, undo/redo, relationship graphs, sync.

## Core Principles

### No-Delete Policy

Users cannot delete items. This is a core design principle for audit compliance:

- **Archive** (soft delete) replaces deletion
- `archivedAt` timestamp hides from active lists but preserves all data
- Full provenance trail maintained
- Every state change is recorded in append-only history

### Paperclip Design Language

1. **Everything Is an Object** — visible boundaries, stable identity
2. **Relationships Over Navigation** — typed connections between items
3. **Gravity Creates Focus** — important items surface naturally
4. **Reversibility Is Sacred** — no destructive defaults, always undo
5. **AI Is a Contributor, Not an Authority** — suggestions require explicit attachment
6. **Language Describes Relationships** — "attach/detach", never "add/delete"
7. **Interface-Level Responsiveness** — immediate feedback on every interaction
8. **Speed Over Ceremony** — capture in &lt;2 seconds

### Copilot — The AI Assistant

**Copilot** is the chat agent partner embedded in Senticor Project.

- **Role**: Assists with inbox triage suggestions, Senticor Project planning, weekly review prompts
- **Personality**: Helpful, concise, respectful of user authority (Paperclip principle #5: AI is a contributor, not an authority)
- **Avatar**: Uses the `chat_bubble` Material Symbol icon
- **Interaction model**: Copilot suggests, the user decides. Suggestions appear as detachable attachments — never auto-applied
- **Name origin**: Short for Senticor Project — your personal task management companion
