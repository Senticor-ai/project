# Epic: Release Process & Hygiene

**Status:** Closed
**Closed on:** February 23, 2026
**Decision owner:** Product + Engineering

## Decision

This epic is closed as a standalone implementation epic.

The currently implemented release/deploy flow is treated as baseline operating process and is now
documented in [Engineering / Deployment](?path=/docs/engineering-deployment--docs).

Remaining enhancements are tracked as roadmap projects in
[Product / Roadmap Projects](?path=/docs/product-roadmap-projects--docs).

## What is in place today

- GitHub Actions enforces quality/test gates before image publishing.
- Frontend, backend, and storybook images are built and pushed with immutable SHA tags.
- Production manifests are automatically updated to the deployed SHA in
  `infra/k8s/overlays/production/kustomization.yaml`.
- Deploy commits are written with `deploy: update image tag ... [skip ci]`.
- Coverage artifacts are uploaded for frontend unit and backend integration jobs.

## What moved to roadmap projects

- Named release workflow (`VERSION`, SemVer tag/release automation)
- Test evidence bundling and release asset archival
- Post-deploy smoke checks
- Supply-chain hardening (SBOM/signing)
- Changelog/commit-policy automation and rollback runbook
