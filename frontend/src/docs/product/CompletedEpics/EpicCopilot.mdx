# Epic: Copilot V1 — Chat + Item Creation

**Status:** Closed
**Closed on:** February 23, 2026

## Decision

This epic is closed — V1 shipped across frontend, backend, and agents services.

Design and engineering knowledge is now maintained in permanent documentation:

- [Design / Copilot UX](?path=/docs/design-copilot-ux--docs) — personality, chat panel layout, message types
- [Design / Detachable Attachments](?path=/docs/design-detachable-attachments--docs) — suggestion card lifecycle and visual treatment
- [Engineering / Agents Service](?path=/docs/engineering-agents-service--docs) — tool execution, dual-agent architecture, request flows

## What shipped

- Conversational side panel (desktop ~400px right panel, mobile full-screen overlay)
- `chat_bubble` toggle in `AppHeader`
- Three tools: `create_project_with_actions`, `create_action`, `create_reference`
- Detachable attachment pattern: suggestions as preview cards with Accept / Dismiss / Edit
- German system prompt with bucket guidance
- Copilot personality: helpful, concise, respectful of user authority
- Provenance: items carry `CaptureSource: { kind: "copilot" }`
- Graceful error handling (503 no agents, 502 unreachable, 504 timeout)
- MSW mocking for frontend development
- Full test coverage (unit + integration)

## What moved to V2+

All deferred items were delivered in [Copilot V2+](?path=/docs/product-completed-epics-copilot-v2--docs):

- Conversation history / multi-turn context
- User items in prompt context
- Streaming (NDJSON)
- Model fallback
