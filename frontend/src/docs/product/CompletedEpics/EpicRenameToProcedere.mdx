# Epic: Rename Project to Procedere

**Status:** Archived
**Archived on:** February 23, 2026
**Decision owner:** Product

## Decision

This epic is closed and archived.

Senticor Project is now the active and stable product name. The proposed full rebrand to
"Procedere" is no longer on the delivery plan, and the previous implementation checklist is
intentionally retired.

## Why archived

- Current branding, deployment naming, and documentation are aligned around Senticor Project.
- Rebrand work would be broad and high-risk across code, infra, and user-facing collateral.
- There is no current product or commercial requirement to execute this rename.

## Current guidance

- Keep naming and copy consistent with "Senticor Project."
- Treat any future rebrand as a new, explicitly scoped epic.

## Historical note

The previous detailed migration plan is intentionally removed from active planning docs to reduce
noise in the product epic backlog.
