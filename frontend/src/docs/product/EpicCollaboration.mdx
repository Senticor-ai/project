# Epic: Collaboration Workspace (Shared Projects + Kanban)

**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** Current
**Design direction:** Board-first team workflow

## Context

Senticor Project is strong for personal task execution, but the current project experience is
mostly single-user and list-oriented. To support real joint execution, users need to share a
project with teammates, collaborate on the same work items, and track progress visually.

**Problem:** Two people working on the same initiative cannot reliably coordinate in one shared
project with a clear flow from intake to completion.

**Outcome:** A shared project workspace where registered users can collaborate in either list or
kanban mode, manage action cards together, and track delivery state with a standards-based status model.
The product model remains schema.org-aligned and portable to graph/triple-store representation later.

## User Story

> "I want to share a project with my colleague, switch to a board view when planning execution,
> and move tasks through clear steps so we can manage joint work in one place."

---

## MVP Scope

### 1) Shared project access (registered users only)

- Project owner can add collaborators by email from project settings.
- Invite target must already be a registered user in the system.
- If user is not registered, sharing is blocked with a clear message to register first.
- Owner can remove collaborators.
- Collaborators can view and edit project content.

### 1a) Inline project settings (project title -> more options)

- Project settings are inline in the project workspace, not a separate screen for MVP.
- Clicking the project name opens an inline "More options" section (same interaction style as item edit).
- Inline settings include:
  - add/remove collaborators
  - project due date
- Owner can edit all settings; members can view settings and edit only allowed fields.

### 2) List to Kanban view toggle per project

- A project can be viewed in either list mode (existing behavior) or kanban mode.
- Toggle is available in project workspace header.
- Preference persists per project and user.
- Both views operate on the same underlying items (no duplicate data models).

### 2a) Deep links for project views

- Project list and board views are addressable via stable URL state.
- Opening a deep link restores:
  - selected project
  - selected view mode (`list` or `kanban`)
  - active filters where present (for example tag filter)
- Users can copy/paste URL links to share direct entry points with collaborators.

### 3) Action-only board cards

- Every card shown in kanban is a schema.org `Action`.
- Card UI supports quick inline edits for frequent fields (title, status, due date, assignee/collaborator, tags).
- Quick-add supports minimal required fields; simple edits happen directly on the card.
- Event and asset context is attached to actions through references (for example links to `Event` items or `DigitalDocument`/`CreativeWork` items).
- Double-clicking a card opens an advanced edit panel for complex edits.
- Advanced panel supports full description editing with markdown source + rendered preview (WYSIWYG-like editing flow for MVP).

### 3a) Shared project visual indicator

- Shared projects are visually marked in project lists and headers with a collaboration icon/badge.
- Indicator is visible in both list and kanban views.
- Tooltip/label clarifies that the project has multiple collaborators.

### 3b) Assignee model (owner of action)

- Quick edit supports assigning an action owner.
- Owner picker source priority:
  - users in the system directory
  - contacts from the user's contact list (if available)
  - free-text fallback (for external people, for example email/name not registered in system)
- Data model supports both structured owner reference and free-text owner.

### 3c) Due date UX

- Due date is quick-set directly on cards.
- Visual urgency indicators are visible in board and list:
  - due today
  - overdue
- Sorting/filtering can prioritize urgent cards.

### 3d) Tagging and filtering

- Actions support freeform tags in quick edit.
- Board and list views support filtering by tag.
- Active filters are visible and easy to clear.

### 3e) Comments and revision history

- Any project member can add comments on an action.
- Threaded comments are supported.
- Board cards show a compact comment indicator/count when comments exist.
- Action edits maintain revision history (what changed, who changed it, when).

### 4) Default action statuses (MVP)

Kanban columns map to schema.org `actionStatus` enum values:

1. `Backlog` -> `PotentialActionStatus`
2. `In Progress` -> `ActiveActionStatus`
3. `Done` -> `CompletedActionStatus`
4. `Blocked` -> `FailedActionStatus`

Cards can be moved between statuses via drag-and-drop and keyboard-accessible move actions.

Additional statuses and custom stage labels are out of MVP scope.

### 4a) Dynamic-ready workflow architecture (no custom UI yet)

- Store workflow policy as a project-level definition object, not hardcoded board columns.
- Workflow definition contains:
  - `canonicalStatuses`: the 4 supported `actionStatus` enum values
  - `transitions`: allowed status-to-status edges
  - `defaultStatus`, `doneStatuses`, `blockedStatuses`
  - `columnLabels`: display labels (`Backlog`, `In Progress`, `Done`, `Blocked`)
  - `policyMode`: `open` (MVP) or `restricted` (future)
- Each board card persists schema.org `actionStatus` as canonical status.
- Board columns render from workflow definition (`columnLabels` + mapped `canonicalStatuses`).
- Transition validation always goes through one backend policy function:
  - MVP: `policyMode = "open"` (allow transitions between the 4 default statuses)
  - Future: `policyMode = "restricted"` (enforce transition graph + rules)
- Future customization path:
  - add optional custom stage definitions that map to a canonical `actionStatus`
  - keep `actionStatus` stable for interoperability and reporting

---

## Interaction Model (MVP)

Borrow the following proven patterns:

- Board-first planning with columns as explicit stages
- Quick card creation inside each column
- Drag-and-drop card movement between columns
- Lightweight card details panel for metadata edits

Do not include in MVP:

- Power-ups/automation rules
- Custom column definitions
- External guest invites
- Advanced reporting dashboards

---

## Product Behavior

### Permissions

- `Owner`: manage collaborators, edit all project items, move cards across board states.
- `Member`: edit project items, move cards across board states.
- Non-members cannot access the project.
- Collaboration membership semantics align to schema.org `member` on `Project` (implemented via
  relational membership records in MVP).

### State model

- Board items are `Action` entities only.
- Canonical state field is schema.org `actionStatus`.
- Allowed MVP values:
  - `PotentialActionStatus` (Backlog)
  - `ActiveActionStatus` (In Progress)
  - `CompletedActionStatus` (Done)
  - `FailedActionStatus` (Blocked)
- Source-of-truth for movement is immutable transition events; current `actionStatus` is a
  rebuildable projection for reads.
- Existing list and kanban views derive grouping/sorting from projected `actionStatus`.
- `Event` and `DigitalDocument`/`CreativeWork` items are linked context for actions, not standalone board cards in MVP.

### Project settings UX

- Clicking the project name expands inline settings in context.
- Settings include collaborators and project due date.
- Changes save in place and apply to both list and kanban views.

### Routing and shareability

- URL/query state carries project + view mode so board/list are deep-linkable.
- Opening deep links restores view context and relevant filters.

### Collaboration affordances

- Shared projects show a visible collaboration marker in project chrome.
- Actions expose assignee and comment indicators directly on cards.
- Threaded discussion semantics align with schema.org `Comment` and parent-child comment
  relationships.

### Card edit modes

- Single-click/expanded card: quick inline editing for common fields.
- Double-click: open advanced edit panel for deep edits (full description markdown editing, references, and metadata).

### Multi-user consistency

- Changes by one member are visible to other members on refresh.
- Activity metadata records `updatedBy` and timestamp for auditability.
- Comment and revision history preserve actor and timestamp metadata.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Project owner can add an existing registered user to a project by email.
- Sharing with an unregistered email is rejected with actionable feedback.
- Project header shows a working list/kanban toggle.
- Project list/board URLs are deep-linkable and restore project + view mode on load.
- Clicking project name opens inline settings with collaborator management and due date.
- Shared projects show a visible collaboration icon/badge.
- Kanban board shows 4 default columns mapped to `actionStatus`: Backlog, In Progress, Done, Blocked.
- Users can create `Action` cards from board UI.
- Action cards can attach/link event and asset context (for example Event and DigitalDocument references).
- Action owner can be set quickly from directory/contacts or free-text fallback.
- Due date can be set quickly on cards and clearly indicates today/overdue states.
- Freeform tags can be added quickly and filtered in list/kanban.
- Cards show comment indicator/count; threaded comments are accessible from card/detail.
- Action edits are revisioned with actor + timestamp.
- Card quick-edit works inline and double-click opens advanced edit panel.
- Cards can move between columns and persist after page reload.
- Board and list views stay consistent via shared `actionStatus` source.
- Both owner and member can collaborate on the same project without permission leakage.

## Appendix A: Schema-Aligned Architecture and Setup

### A1) Modeling Principles

- Keep ontology and storage concerns separate.
- Treat each board card as schema.org `Action`.
- Represent movement between columns as immutable transition facts (events), not destructive status overwrites.
- Keep schema.org semantics first; extend only where schema.org has no precise construct.
- Design so relational storage can map cleanly to RDF/triple representation later.

### A2) Conceptual Model (Ontology Layer)

- `Project` with `member` relationships for collaboration access.
- `Action` as the progressed unit shown on the board.
- `actionStatus` as canonical lifecycle status.
- `Comment` for user discussion, with threaded parent-child linkage.
- `Event`, `DigitalDocument`, `CreativeWork` as referenced context linked to `Action`.
- `BookmarkAction` can model saved personal view presets/deep links in future iterations.

### A3) Practical Postgres Model (Backend)

Core tables:

1. `action` (stable identity + editable content)
2. `action_transition_event` (append-only movement/audit log)
3. `action_state_projection` (current state snapshot for fast reads)
4. `workflow_state` and `workflow_transition` (workflow as data)
5. `project_member` (collaboration access)
6. `action_comment` (threaded comments)
7. `action_revision` (content change history)

Recommended fields (MVP-level):

1. `action`
   - `id`, `project_id`, `name`, `description`, `action_status`, `owner_user_id`,
     `owner_text`, `due_at`, `tags`, `object_ref`, `attributes`, `created_at`, `created_by`
2. `action_transition_event`
   - `id`, `ts`, `action_id`, `actor_id`, `from_status`, `to_status`, `reason`, `payload`,
     `correlation_id`
3. `action_state_projection`
   - `action_id`, `status`, `updated_at`, `last_event_id`
4. `project_member`
   - `project_id`, `user_id`, `role`, `added_at`, `added_by`
5. `action_comment`
   - `id`, `action_id`, `author_id`, `parent_comment_id`, `body`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
6. `action_revision`
   - `id`, `action_id`, `actor_id`, `diff`, `created_at`

Notes:

- `action_transition_event` is append-only and becomes the audit/provenance source.
- `action_state_projection` is rebuildable from events.
- No backward compatibility constraints are required (pre-release), so model can be introduced directly.

### A4) API/Service Shape

Command-side operations:

1. `createAction`
2. `updateActionFields` (quick edit and advanced edit)
3. `transitionActionStatus` (validates workflow, appends event, updates projection)
4. `addComment` / `replyComment`
5. `addProjectMember` / `removeProjectMember`

Query-side operations:

1. `listProjectActions` (list/board view from projection)
2. `getActionDetail` (references, comments, revisions)
3. `listActionHistory` (transitions + revisions timeline)

Concurrency:

- Use optimistic concurrency for transitions (`expected_last_event_id` or equivalent).
- Reject stale transitions with actionable UI feedback.

### A5) Frontend Alignment

- Board/list always render from projected `actionStatus`.
- Move operation calls transition command API (never writes status directly without command path).
- Quick edit on card: title, status move, assignee, due date, tags.
- Advanced panel: full description markdown editing, references, threaded comments, revision timeline.
- Project header holds inline settings and deep-linkable list/board routes.

### A6) CLI/Agent Enablement

Expose agent-safe commands/endpoints for:

1. list projects and members
2. list actions by status/tag/assignee/due
3. create/update/transition actions
4. add/read comments and revisions
5. manage collaborators

Operational requirements:

- Include actor identity and correlation ID for each write.
- Return both projection state and last event metadata for deterministic automation.

### A7) Schema Compliance Boundary

Use schema.org terms directly where available:

1. `Project`, `member`
2. `Action`, `actionStatus`
3. `Comment`
4. `Event`, `DigitalDocument`, `CreativeWork`
5. `BookmarkAction` (optional saved-view capability)

Extend with product namespace only for workflow internals not covered by schema.org:

1. transition-event envelope fields
2. workflow policy/guard metadata
3. projection bookkeeping

### A8) Initial Setup Sequence

1. Add DB tables for `action_transition_event`, `action_state_projection`, `project_member`,
   `action_comment`, `action_revision`, workflow policy tables.
2. Implement transition command service + workflow validator.
3. Implement projection updater + rebuild tool from event log.
4. Wire list/board APIs to projection reads.
5. Wire UI quick edit + advanced edit panel to command/query APIs.
6. Add preflight checks for docs + Storybook indexing and collaboration flow tests.
