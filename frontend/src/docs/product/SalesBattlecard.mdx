# Senticor Project – Sales Battlecard

## Positioning

**Senticor Project** is an **open, sovereign procedure-ontology platform** for public-sector casework. It enables **human–AI co-execution** of legally defined procedures on **self-hosted or EU-based infrastructure**, with full auditability and long-term vendor independence.

> _We don't optimize dashboards. We govern procedures._

---

## The Market Reality (What buyers are used to)

Public-sector buyers typically evaluate solutions from three established categories:

1. **Data Mining / Analytics Platforms**
   Focused on aggregating data and producing insights, dashboards, and KPIs.

2. **Process Intelligence / Process Mining Tools**
   Reconstruct processes from logs to analyze efficiency and bottlenecks.

3. **Work Tracking / Case Management Systems**
   Track tasks, tickets, or cases, often with rigid workflows and forms.

Senticor Project deliberately sits **outside** these categories.

---

## Senticor Project Category Definition

**Procedural Intelligence Platform**

Senticor Project models **what the administration is legally allowed and required to do**, not just what happened in the past or what is currently tracked in a system.

It makes procedures explicit, executable, explainable, and evolvable.

## Competitive Comparison (Use in conversations)

### vs. Data Mining / Analytics Platforms

**They:**

- Start from raw data
- Optimize reporting and insight generation
- Require analysts and dashboards

**Senticor Project:**

- Starts from legally defined procedures
- Guides concrete casework
- Supports clerks directly in daily work

**Sales line:**

> "Analytics explains the past. Senticor Project governs the present."

---

### vs. Process Intelligence / Process Mining

**They:**

- Reconstruct processes from event logs
- Focus on optimization and efficiency
- Describe what _is happening_

**Senticor Project:**

- Encodes the _intended_ and lawful procedure
- Detects deviations with legal context
- Describes what _should happen_

**Sales line:**

> "Process mining shows deviations. Senticor Project defines legitimacy."

---

### vs. Work Tracking / Case Management Systems

**They:**

- Track tasks, tickets, or cases
- Hard-coded workflows
- Limited semantic understanding

**Senticor Project:**

- Models cases, procedures, decisions, and obligations
- Flexible, ontology-driven execution
- Built for complex administrative reality

**Sales line:**

> "Work tracking records work. Senticor Project understands work."

---

## Key Differentiators (Memorize these)

### 1. Open Ontology

- Based on schema.org + extensions
- Transparent, inspectable, versionable
- Not locked to a single vendor or runtime

### 2. Sovereign Compute

- Self-hosted, on-prem, or EU cloud
- Compatible with BSI / EU AI Act requirements
- Models and infrastructure are replaceable

### 3. Human–AI Co‑Execution

- AI agents act as junior case workers
- Humans retain legal responsibility
- Clear role separation and accountability

### 4. Built‑in Legitimacy

- Provenance of data and decisions
- Rule traceability
- Audit-ready by design

---

## Typical Objections & Responses

### "We already have analytics dashboards."

**Response:**

> "Great — Senticor Project doesn't replace analytics. It governs the actual administrative work where legal responsibility lies."

---

### "We already use a case management system."

**Response:**

> "Senticor Project can complement or gradually replace it. Traditional systems track cases; Senticor Project understands and executes procedures."

---

### "AI is risky for legal decisions."

**Response:**

> "That's exactly why Senticor Project keeps humans legally responsible and makes every AI action explainable and auditable."

---

## Ideal Entry Use Cases

- Förderanträge with recurring procedures
- Sammelakten across multiple years
- High-volume, rule-bound casework
- Knowledge transfer in understaffed administrations

---

## Closing Line (Use this)

> **Senticor Project is not another analytics or workflow tool.
> It is the procedural backbone for legally accountable, AI-supported administration.**
