# The Principles of Paperclip Design

Paperclip design is not a visual trend. It is a **workspace philosophy** for complex,
knowledge-heavy, AI-assisted systems (government, legal, research, ops).

Use this as a **design review checklist**, not as inspiration fluff.

For how these principles map to Apple HIG, see
[Design Philosophy](?path=/docs/design-philosophy--docs).
Component implementations live alongside each component as co-located MDX docs
(see `Primitives/` and `Work/` in the sidebar).

## 1. Everything Is an Object (Object-Oriented UX)

**Foundations**

- Rooted in: object-oriented design, direct manipulation (Shneiderman), desktop metaphors

**Principle**
Every meaningful thing must exist as a first-class, addressable object.

**Checklist**

- Emails are objects (not rows)
- Documents are objects (not files hidden behind buttons)
- Notes are objects (with lifecycle and provenance)
- AI outputs are objects (never inline magic text)
- Procedures / rules are objects (attachable, detachable)

**UX Signals**

- Visible boundaries (cards, sheets)
- Stable identity (title, type, timestamp)
- Can exist before being "placed" anywhere

> If users can talk about it, it must be an object.

---

## 2. Relationships Over Navigation (Context by Attachment)

**Foundations**

- Rooted in: information architecture, graph thinking, sense-making systems

**Principle**
Meaning is created by _relationships_, not by moving between pages.

**Checklist**

- Users attach objects instead of navigating to screens
- Relationships are always visible
- Objects can have multiple parents
- Detaching is as easy as attaching

**UX Signals**

- Clip / attachment chips
- "Attached to ..." sections
- No hidden system state

> The UI answers "What is connected?" instead of "Where am I?"

---

## 3. Gravity Creates Focus (Progressive Commitment)

**Foundations**

- Rooted in: progressive disclosure, cognitive load theory

**Principle**
Focus is created by _attraction_, not by hiding or locking UI.

**Checklist**

- Inbox shows loose, uncommitted objects
- Case clusters objects without removing them
- Procedure applies constraints without changing layout
- Switching focus never destroys context

**UX Signals**

- Sticky headers
- Highlighted clusters
- Constraint badges

> Focus emerges by attraction, not by exclusion.

---

## 4. Reversibility Is Sacred (Safety by Design)

**Foundations**

- Rooted in: undo/redo, error-tolerant design

**Principle**
Users must never fear exploration.

**Checklist**

- Attachments are reversible
- Procedures can be removed
- AI suggestions can be discarded
- Drafts auto-save
- No destructive default actions

**UX Signals**

- "Detach" instead of "Delete"
- History / provenance available
- No irreversible primary buttons

> Power comes from safety, not control.

---

## 5. AI Is a Contributor, Not an Authority

**Foundations**

- Rooted in: human-in-the-loop systems, explainable AI

**Principle**
AI produces _artifacts_, never decisions.

**Checklist**

- AI outputs appear as separate objects
- AI suggestions require explicit attachment
- AI reasoning is inspectable
- Human actions are always distinguishable

**UX Signals**

- AI badges
- Preview cards
- "Accept / discard" affordances

> Trust is built by optionality.

---

## 6. Language Describes Relationships (Mental Model Alignment)

**Foundations**

- Rooted in: cognitive linguistics, usability heuristics

**Principle**
Words must reinforce object + relationship thinking.

**Checklist**

- "Attach" replaces "Save"
- "Detach" replaces "Remove"
- "Applies to" replaces "Belongs in"
- Nouns > verbs

**UX Signals**

- Relationship-first labels
- No generic CRUD language

> Language is interaction design.

---

## 7. Interface-Level Responsiveness (paperclip-punk)

**Foundations**

- Rooted in: feedback loops, exploratory data viz, developer tools

**Principle**
The interface teaches the system by responding immediately.

**Checklist**

- Hover reveals meaning
- Scroll animates structure
- Comparisons animate differences
- No static diagrams

**UX Signals**

- On-hover inspectors
- Animated diffs
- Live previews

> The interface explains itself by reacting.

---

## 8. Speed Over Ceremony (Low-Friction Understanding)

**Foundations**

- Rooted in: minimal viable cognition

**Principle**
Understanding should be faster than reading.

**Checklist**

- Instant previews
- Inline comparisons
- No mandatory walkthroughs
- Zero-friction copy / attach

**UX Signals**

- Fast scrolling narratives
- Progressive reveal

> If it needs a tutorial, it is not paperclip-native.

## Styling Checklist (paperclip-punk compatible)

- Light background
- Paper-like neutral surfaces
- Blueprint accent colors (industrial blue / orange)
- Neutral grotesk or mono fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono)
- Subtle motion (lift, snap, unfold)
- No decorative gradients

> Visuals exist to reveal structure, not to impress.

## Composition Rules

Cross-cutting rules that apply across all Paperclip components.

### Card Sizes

and primary action button (if applicable).

| Component                 | Empty Message                                    | Action                            | Status      |

## Final Litmus Test

A system is paperclip-native if:

- users can explain how it works without training
- AI never surprises them
- nothing feels irreversible
- meaning emerges through interaction

---

## One-Line Summary

Paperclip design creates fast, reversible, object-centric workspaces where meaning
is built through visible relationships and responsive interfaces — not screens,
forms, or automation magic.
