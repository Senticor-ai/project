# Vision & Methodology

<SlideShow>

<Slide n={1} title="The 5 Phases" tag="Core Loop">

| #   | Phase        | Action  | Trigger                               | Output                          |
| --- | ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Capture**  | Collect | Thought, email, file, voice           | Item in Inbox                   |
| 2   | **Clarify**  | Process | FIFO from oldest item                 | Routed item with context        |
| 3   | **Organize** | Route   | After clarify decision                | Item in correct bucket          |
| 4   | **Reflect**  | Review  | Weekly (60–90 min) + Daily (5–15 min) | Clean lists, updated priorities |
| 5   | **Engage**   | Do      | Context + time + energy + priority    | Action completed                |

**The discipline:** FIFO inbox — oldest item first, no skipping.

<Slide n={2} title="The Buckets" tag="Data Model">

| Bucket        | Purpose                                       | Color          |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Inbox**     | Unprocessed captures — FIFO queue             | Warm amber     |
| **Next**      | Immediately actionable, context-tagged        | Green          |
| **Projects**  | Multi-step outcomes with sequential actions   | Blueprint blue |
| **Waiting**   | Delegated — with person + expected date       | Purple         |
| **Calendar**  | Time-specific commitments                     | Red-orange     |
| **Reference** | Supporting material, not actionable           | Muted olive    |
| **Later**     | Deferred aspirations, reviewed weekly         | Cool cyan      |
| **Focus**     | Virtual filtered view — high-priority overlay | Bold orange    |

No hard deletes — items are **archived** (`archived_at`), never destroyed.

</Slide>

<Slide n={3} title="The Clarify Decision Tree" tag="Triage Logic">

```
Is it actionable?
├── YES
│   ├── Will it take <2 min? → DO IT NOW
│   ├── Should someone else do it? → WAITING (delegated)
│   └── What's the next action?
│       ├── Single step → NEXT
│       ├── Multi-step → PROJECT + first action
│       └── Time-specific → CALENDAR
└── NO
    ├── No longer relevant → ARCHIVE
    ├── Maybe later → LATER
    └── Good reference → REFERENCE
```

Each clarified item gets: **desired outcome**, **next physical action**, **context**, **energy level**, **time estimate**.
