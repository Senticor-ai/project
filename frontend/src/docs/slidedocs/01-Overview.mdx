# Product Overview

<SlideShow>

<Slide n={1} title="What Is Senticor Project?" tag="Elevator Pitch">

> **Structured task management with AI-assisted triage, built for German federal clerks.**

A disciplined five-phase inbox-to-execution system that captures every commitment,
routes it to the right bucket, and keeps you in control — backed by an AI Copilot
that triages, enriches, and connects evidence without replacing your judgment.

| Dimension       | Value                                                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**        | Bundesbeamte — German federal clerks managing cases, procedures, documents |
| **Core loop**   | Capture → Clarify → Organize → Reflect → Engage                            |
| **AI role**     | Contributor, not authority — suggests, never overwrites                    |
| **Data policy** | Append-only audit trail; no deletes, full provenance                       |
| **Language**    | German UI, English code, German LLM prompts                                |

<Slide n={2} title="The Problem We Solve" tag="Why">

German federal clerks manage high-stakes, multi-party procedures — tax assessments,
benefit applications, permit reviews — with fragmented tools and no structured inbox.

| Pain                      | Symptom                                   | Our Answer                                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Information overload      | Emails + documents scattered across silos | Single capture inbox, FIFO processing             |
| Loss of context           | No link between task and evidence         | JSON-LD items with provenance + file attachments  |
| Compliance pressure       | Full audit trail required by law          | Append-only model, `archived_at` soft-delete only |
| Manual triage             | Clerk reads each item to decide action    | AI Copilot auto-classifies and suggests routing   |
| No next-action discipline | Tasks stall mid-procedure                 | Sequential project actions enforce order          |
