# Epic: Identify Missing Documents

**Status:** Not started
**Priority:** Future

---

## Context

After triaging existing documents, the user realizes some are missing — a
1099-INT from a savings account, a K-1 from a partnership. These become
actions: next actions (things the user must download) or waiting-for items
(delegated to a third party). This flow already works with the existing
capture → triage pipeline.

## User Story

> "After processing what I have, I realize I'm missing the 1099-INT from my
> savings account and the K-1 from the partnership."

---

## Flow

1. User captures: "Download 1099-INT from Ally Bank"
2. Triages to Next with context `@computer`
3. Captures: "Request K-1 from XYZ Partners"
4. Triages to Waiting (delegated to partnership)

| ------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Capture text → triage to next action | Works       | Standard workflow                                |
| Waiting with delegation              | Works       | `delegatedTo` property + waiting bucket          |
| Context assignment                   | Model ready | `contexts` field exists but no context picker UI |
