# ADR-001: Schema.org as Primary Ontology

**Status:** Accepted

---

## Context

The application manages tasks, documents, people, events, and projects for diverse
use cases (tax preparation, job search, administrative proceedings). We needed a
data model that is:

- Extensible without schema migrations
- Interoperable with external systems
- Self-describing (types carry semantics, not just structure)

## Decision

Use [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) JSON-LD as the canonical data representation.
Every item is a Schema.org type (`Action`, `Project`, `CreativeWork`, `DigitalDocument`,
`Person`, `Event`) stored as a JSON-LD document with `@type`, `@id`, and standard
Schema.org properties.

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- No custom type system to design and maintain
- Items are immediately understandable by any system that speaks Schema.org/JSON-LD
- New types can be added without database migrations (just new `@type` values)
- The LLM copilot can reason about items using Schema.org's well-documented vocabulary

**Negative:**
- Schema.org types don't always map 1:1 to our domain concepts — we use
  `additionalProperty` for app-specific fields like `bucket`
- JSON-LD serialization/deserialization adds complexity vs. flat relational rows
- Some Schema.org properties have ambiguous semantics requiring team conventions
