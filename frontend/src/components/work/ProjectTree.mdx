# ProjectTree

Hierarchical view of multi-step projects with sequential actions. Each project
expands to reveal its ordered action list, with the next action highlighted.

Embodies **Principle 1: Everything Is an Object** — projects are first-class objects
with visible boundaries, and **Principle 3: Gravity Creates Focus** — the next action
is visually promoted while future actions are dimmed.

## Features

- **Expand/collapse**: click a project to reveal its actions (accordion — one at a time)
- **Sequential actions**: next action highlighted with blueprint ring, completed actions show strikethrough
- **Stalled detection**: projects with no next action show a warning icon
- **Active/inactive toggle**: non-active projects (completed, on-hold) hidden by default, toggle to reveal
- **Rapid entry**: inline text input at the bottom to add actions to a project
- **Create project**: inline form (name + desired outcome) via header "+" button — no modals, no ceremony
