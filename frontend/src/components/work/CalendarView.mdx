# CalendarView

> **Status**: Implemented (List + Week + Month)

Calendar surface for `app:bucket = "calendar"` events with:

- List, Week, and Month modes
- Shared event detail/editor
- RSVP (`accept`, `tentative`, `decline`)
- Reschedule (`+30 min` and direct date-time edits)
- Delete with provider fallback behavior
- Sync-state badges (`Synced`, `Saving`, `Sync failed`, `Local only`)

The component consumes `/calendar/events` records and routes writes through:

- `PATCH /calendar/events/{canonical_id}`
- `POST /calendar/events/{canonical_id}/rsvp`
- `DELETE /calendar/events/{canonical_id}`

## UX Notes

- List and grid modes open the same detail panel for parity.
- Non-writable provider events show disabled edit/delete controls with explanation.
- Notification-driven urgent proposals open Copilot; calendar actions remain directly available from this view.
- Timed events render with 24-hour `HH:MM` labels (no AM/PM).
- End-to-end flow reference: [Flows/Inbox to Calendar + Copilot Alerts](?path=/docs/flows-inbox-to-calendar-copilot-alerts--docs).

## Empty State

"Clear schedule" with an "Add calendar entry" button.
