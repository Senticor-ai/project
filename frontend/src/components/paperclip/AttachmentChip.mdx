# AttachmentChip

Visualizes [LexCEL typed references](?path=/docs/engineering-ontology-lexcel-architecture--docs)
between items. Each chip represents a directional relationship — the physical metaphor
is a paper clip attaching one document to another.

This embodies **Principle 2: Relationships Over Navigation** — instead of burying
connections in menus, they're visible as chips on the card surface.
